**Overview:**

This project builds on previous projects funded by U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to establish an EPA central exchange network data flow (EPA Grant OS-83325101-2).   The goal of this project was to design a new system for the State of Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection (CT DEEP) that significantly increases the data that CT DEEP flows to EPA’s water quality exchange (WQX) system to support easier and more transparent public access to CT DEEP’s water quality data.  CT DEEP replaced its legacy data system with a new system, the Connecticut ambient water data exchange system (awX).  awX was developed to meet the current WQX schema requirements, as well as provide new capabilities from the legacy system of automated data transfer mechanism from the local system to WQX.  To facilitate this, awX was developed to meet WQX 3.0 schema requirements and flow data to WQX using the WQX web node and application programming interface (API).  In addition, awX is configured to support data flow of new elements and parameters to WQX that were not previously supported by the legacy system.  awX was also developed in way that can be regularly maintain, updated and adapted as needed by the CT DEEP Monitoring and Assessment Program.  Additional components to awX outside the scope of the grant are currently in development to support time series monitoring data collected with water sensors, as well as trail camera image stream connectivity data.
